# Why would you do that?
Repository for the BCS-IITK semester project "Why would you do that?" started in June 2021.

# Abstract
Neuroeconomics seeks to explain human decision making, the ability of an agent to process multiple alternatives and to follow a course of action. In general, a population of people thrives when they depict certain social behaviors. Small individual choices can have huge impacts on the population. In this project we’ll be taking a look at how multi-agent systems interact and produce macro-effects as a result of micro-choices, and how those results in turn affect the future decisions of the agents. We’ll create a simple agent that can decide whether to show altruistic traits or not, in an artificial environment to maximize it’s chances of survival (we will be creating and customizing this environment as well), we’ll simulate this on a number of populations with various constraints to find patterns. Next, we’ll try to create a simple Q-Learning model/any other suitable model to take into account the variability in the agent decisions based on environmental input (reinforcement).
